## Team
We are two people ([@brewkode](https://github.com/brewkode) and [@ashwanthkumar](https://github.com/ashwanthkumar) at this point. We have worked with each other for a while, we understand each other's strengths and gaps. Both of us have been leading critical projects for a while and we have played different roles in different sized orgs. We enjoy mentoring / making things better and leaving the place better than before. We are pragmatically opinionated. Most of our answers start with -- "it depends", followed by questions.
